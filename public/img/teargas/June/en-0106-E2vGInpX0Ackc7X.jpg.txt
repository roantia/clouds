@rat_king20 @sammajammaz I was there that day. Non-violent daytime crowd just got attacked for Trump's photo op. National guard on every street corner. Later that night we had a military helicopter fly low + cause stampede. They then chased protesters into residential homes with teargas + flash grenades. https://t.co/4PyjlmZOaN
